Hi,I'm Anchor.And i graduated from China University of Geosciences.
My major subject is Computer Science And Technology,i learned c++ mostly during the undergraduate period.
In 2018,i hired by Midea Group and come to ShunDe.In the demand of my first team,i turned to learn Java.
Sine then,i started my programmer career.
I had worked for three project teams in Midea.
The first and second team's primary mission is developing a Devops platform.
So i learned some devops skills like jenkins build sonar scan and etc.
But i think my main technical improvement was on the third team.
In that stage,we developed some systems for Midea staff,like Midea Live„ÄÅMidea Talk and Midea News.
I was in charge of Midea Live System and developed some exciting functions like Live Praise and Live Comment.
This system provide live broadcast capabilities for the entire company.And tt built on Tencent CSS platform.
Lastly,my main develop skills are SpringBoot SpringCloud Mysql MongoDB Redis RocketMq Linux Shell and Python.
That's all.Thanks.
